Base on positive covariance (~0.000010) and beta < 1 (0.03093001487238774) of the TIGER GLOBAL MANAGEMENT LLC, we can say that company's bahavior is pretty same with market but changing of an asset value more sensitive to movement's of market because it is stands closer to S&P500.

I would recommend to add BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC to the firm's suite, because the covariance of the asset is 0,00002 > 0 and behaviors is pretty same with the market but changing of asset value (beta = 0,2) is less than market changing of value (1). And I would buy it as it moves more smoothly.
